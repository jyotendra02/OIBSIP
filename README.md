# Project Showcase

This repository showcases three different projects: a landing page, a portfolio, and a temperature converter. Each project is described briefly below:

## Landing Page

The landing page project is a simple and responsive webpage designed to introduce a product, service, or company. It typically consists of a header, sections with information about the product/service, and a call-to-action section. The landing page aims to capture the visitor's attention and encourage them to take a specific action, such as signing up or making a purchase.

## Portfolio

The portfolio project is a personal website that showcases an individual's work, skills, and achievements. It provides an overview of the person's professional background, highlights their projects, and may include a resume or contact information. The portfolio is often used by freelancers, designers, developers, or anyone looking to display their work and attract potential clients or employers.

## Temperature Converter

The temperature converter project is a handy tool for converting temperatures between different units, such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It allows users to input a value in one temperature unit and instantly see the converted value in other units. The temperature converter is useful for anyone who needs to quickly convert temperatures for various purposes, such as cooking, scientific calculations, or weather-related tasks.
